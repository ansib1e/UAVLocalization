## Introduction
This project focuses on development of a robust geo-localization system on aerial platform leveraging by deep-learning based map retrieval and alignment. 
Two public datasets from [Ageagle](https://ageagle.com/resources/?filter_by=data-set) have been re-organized  to evaluate the proposed algorithms.
A field test in Beijing Haidian has been also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the localization system.	

**Input data:** orthophoto and the target referenced map

**Output data:** extracted geo-coordinates
